=================== 1. Purpose ===============================================

The main purpose of WebResourceBundler gem is to minimize request & response
round-trips count. This could be done by bundling particular resource (css or js) in 
one file. Encoding images in base64 and putting then in css directly.

=================== 2. Functional description ================================

WebResourceBundler parse your head html block, finding all css and js resource 
files.
It can bundle resource of particular type in one single file. Base64 filter
encodes images in base64 putting them in css directly. Separate files for IE
and other browsers created. Conditional comments (like <!--[if IE 6]>) also
supported. You can use external image hosts to server images in css: 
cdn filter can rewrite image urls for you.

=================== 3. Installation ==========================================

gem install web_resource_bundle

It's pretty easy, yeah?

=================== 4. Usage ================================================= 

To use bundler in rails app you should create initializer file in
/path/to/your/rails_app/config/initializers/ directory
Let's say it will be web_resource_bundler_init.rb
Then you should put content like this in it.

require 'web_resource_bundler'
settings = {
  :resource_dir => File.join(Rails.root, 'public'), #use RAILS_ROOT while using rails older than rails 3
  :log_path => File.join(Rails.root, 'log/web_resource_bundler.log'), #path to your log file
  :cache_dir => 'cache', #cache dir where to put bundle files
  :base64_filter => {
    :max_image_size => 23, #kbytes, bigger images won't be encoded in base64 for efficiency
    :protocol => 'http',
    :domain => 'localhost:3000' #!be sure to set only domain, not http://domain
  },
  :bundle_filter => {
    :md5_additional_data => [] #additional data that will be used to compute md5
  },
  :cdn_filter => {
    :http_hosts => ['http://localhost:3000'],
    :https_hosts => ['https://localhost:3000']
  }
}
WebResourceBundler::Bundler.new(settings)
ActionView::Base.send(:include, WebResourceBundler::RailsAppHelpers)

Now in your view files you can call web_resource_bundler_process helper like this:

<head>
<% web_resource_bundler_process do %>
  <%= stylesheet_link_tag :scaffold %>
  <%= javascript_include_tag :defaults %>
<% end %>
</head>

!!!
Don't forget to clean your cache directory after deploy to clean old bundles
